 * Intrinsic metadata for one chain + standard. The `id` reuses the original profile slug; the `template` is the single
 * source of truth from which the path string and the recognizer are both derived.
 *
 * Explorer/RPC/wallet-UX glue (endpoints, ss58 prefixes, hrp, class hashes, ...) is deliberately excluded: if a field
 * changes when you swap explorer, RPC, or wallet, it does not belong here. UTXO output-descriptor kind/template (see
 * `../descriptors.js`) is the one exception: it is a pure function of `addressKind`, not a wallet or explorer choice,
 * so it is modeled separately rather than excluded.
